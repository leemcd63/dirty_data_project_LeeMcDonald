# Dirty Data Project

Here you will find my work from Week 4 at CodeClan. 

Our first project week involved cleaning multiple dirty data sets, and carrying out analysis after cleaning.

## Overview

Each folder within this repo contains a different task, there were six tasks in total. Within each task there are folders for:

* data_cleaning_script - contains an R script which cleans and tidies the raw data, and outputs to a .csv file.
* analysis_and_documentation - contains an R notebook file containing analysis and an explanation of the cleaning script.

Please open each task using the .Rproj file located in the root folder, before running any scripts.
